[Advent of Code - 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) in C.

I don't have any production experience working with C, but know the basics
from school and some random internet posts. My primary language at work is
Python, I also speak TS/JS and a bit of Rust.

I'll try to stay within pure C (C11, compiled with GCC), but may later decide
to include and link `glib` to avoid writing hashmap and hashset from scratch.
